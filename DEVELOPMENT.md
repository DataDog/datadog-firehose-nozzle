# Development

## Setup

Dependencies are managed using Glide. 
In order to build, install or run tests, first [install glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide).
Then, pull dependencies by calling:
```
glide install
```

## Testing

You need [ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) to run the tests. The tests can be executed with:
```
ginkgo -r
```
